# Support Vector Machine

This experiment demonstrate the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks.

## What is SVM?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in high-dimensional space. SVM is effective in handling both linear and non-linear data and is valued for its robustness and ability to maximize the margin between classes, leading to more reliable classifications.

## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, I applied SVM to a labeled dataset to accomplish the following:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by scaling features for optimal SVM performance.
2. **Model Training**: Trained the SVM model on the training dataset, tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: Tested the model on the validation dataset and analyzed its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **Visualization**: Plotted decision boundaries to illustrate how SVM separates different classes.

## Results and Importance

The results from the SVM experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of SVM in classification. Key takeaways include:

- **High Classification Accuracy**: The SVM model showed strong performance on the dataset, effectively distinguishing between classes.
- **Robustness to Overfitting**: SVM maintained generalizability across data, reducing overfitting risks through margin maximization.
- **Versatility**: SVM performed well even with non-linear data due to the kernel trick, making it adaptable to various datasets.

In summary, this experiment highlights SVM's capabilities in classification, particularly in situations where separating data into classes with maximum margin is essential.
